5,Exceptional,Everything absolutely lovely place customer experience 11/10. Elevator was a bit worrying
4,Good experience but for the cost of staying there I’d rather go to another property,"Amazing location, cleanliness, staff, sauna and steam rooms, pool. Rooms were great, view is great from rooms. Staff were outstanding. Food taste could’ve been better. Tasted bland and for the price the property charges you’d expect the meal to be exceptional but it fell short. My significant other had a terrible experience at the spa for a message session booked with their spa team. We explained our experience to them and the attempted to recover with a free supper experience but as mentioned above the meal just falls short every time. It really bothers me to write this cause the staff is so kind and tentative so I have to give them the credit for trying."

4.5,"Nice stay, best place to stay in Addis","I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Haile Grand Addis Hotel, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the excellent service provided by the staff. Not only were they professional and attentive, but they also seemed genuinely happy to be working there, which created a warm and welcoming atmosphere throughout my stay. One aspect that particularly stood out to me was the cleanliness of the hotel. The rooms were immaculate, and the common areas were always well-maintained. It's evident that the hotel takes great pride in ensuring a high standard of cleanliness for its guests. Furthermore, I was impressed by the availability and willingness of the staff to assist with any requests or inquiries. Whether it was the shuttle driver who ensured smooth transportation, the room service staff who provided prompt and delicious meals, the receptionist who was always helpful and accommodating, or the cleaners who kept the rooms spotless, everyone went above and beyond to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The Haile Grand Addis Hotel truly provides international tourism standards that rival many other places I've stayed in Addis Ababa. It's evident that they prioritize the satisfaction of their guests, and it shows in every aspect of their service. Overall, my experience at Haile Grand Addis Hotel was exceptional, and I would not hesitate to return or recommend it to others.

The elevator got locked on us and we stayed in there for about 30 minutes. It took a long time for a technician to open it manually.

0.5,Bad,"It is a beautiful luxury hotel, everything is new.
The hotel has not had internet for 6 days, elevators was not working for 2 days, the TV in the room doesn't work, the phones in the room doesn't work, the treadmill in their gym doesn't work. As this trip was work trip, it was impossible to get some work done. The hotel staff kept promising how internet issues will be fixed by 8 AM, then by 12..
When I asked to cancel my reservation for the remaining days that I had left, they refused to reimburse me. I had make a new booking at another hotel. I still have not been reimbursed even though the manager promised I would get my money as soon as they receive email, booking.com has sent several emails and no response from Haile Grand."

Every single staff member is amazingly friendly, gracious, and ready to assist in any way they can! The swimming pool is beautiful, and a high standard of cleanliness is maintained. It was difficult to believe that you are in such a densely populated city."
5,Exceptional,"Loved this place! Staff are so friendly and professional. Room was gorgeous. Grounds are lovely. Pool area and wellness Center were clean and well organised. The only disappointment was my dinner. I sat in the bar area and my food came and it was cold and I didn’t like it. I am not a picky eater and have eaten lots of great Ethiopian food. The sandwich had a sauce on it that tasted terrible. They wanted to replace it but I was not longer hungry. They offered me a plate of fruit which was very nice. BUT, when the bill came, they had charged me for the meal! I tried to discuss it with the server and he refused to even take 1/2 the amount. Don’t let this discourage you from enjoying this place. I just had a bit of bad luck!"

One of the standout features of my stay was undoubtedly the culinary experience. The food at Haile Grand Addis Ababa surpassed all expectations, offering a diverse and delectable menu that showcased the finest in local Ethiopian and international cuisine. Each meal was a culinary masterpiece, a testament to the skill and creativity of the chefs. Whether it was breakfast, lunch, or dinner, every dish was a delightful exploration of flavors.
