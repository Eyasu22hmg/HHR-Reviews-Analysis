5,Exceptional,"Clean hotel and also the staff are nice and very friendly ??It was a great experience
The room is beautiful and comfortable"
4,A pleasant experience,"It was an excellent hotel and the staff couldn’t do enough for me
There was no shuttle to pick me up. I had to make my own way there. They seemed reluctant to pick me up when I called"
4,Really was a new feeling,"The view, stuff. All facilities
The foods not so much"
4,My stay was comfortable.,"The breakfast was good and staff very courteous.
The room need exterminator for bugs in bathroom. The resort needs renovation repair work."
4,Very good,"What I like is the view in front of the hotel.
Some times no water some times no light"
3.5,"Probably the best choice in the town, but with its own issues","The service is really excellent - the staff is trained to greet&smile to the guests and that creates a really good ambience. One non-apparent advantage of the hotel - they have their own electricity generators, which helps a lot when there are power shortages in the city (that is quite common). The view from the windows is hard to beat (if your room is facing the city, of course - this needs to be double-checked). In general, there are many official UN and alike delegations hosted in the hotel, so this might also be a sign of relative quality.
The general cleanliness of the room is below average, especially with regard to the bed sheets. My laundry was simply left unattended in the room (because ""there were some problems with the drying machine""), the phone in the room was not functioning at all (and there is no elevator to go down and up from the reception - a considerable drawback given the city's altitude of 2,500m)."
4,Very good,"Best breakfast in Ethiopia I found to western standards.
Leaking bathtub in the room"
0.5,Worst experience in Ethiopia. Don’t ever stay there!,"Booked this hotel, because they advertise their swimming pool. The problem is that it’s under constant cleaning/ maintenance and not available to use, even though the staff promise it would be available the following day. Room: cold shower, water doesn’t go down. Restaurant: you never get all toppings on your pizza.
Summery: asked them to discount my bill due to all inconveniences, they refused."
2.5,"May be the best hotel in Gondar, just consider standards are different from other places",WiFi was often saturated and wouldn't allow a connection. Breakfast looked stale. Shower drain was clogged. Bathroom didn't flush properly. Bed linen felt cheap.
5,I am very happy,Good customer service
4.5,Superb,Was very happy with the quality of the accommodation and the airport pickup
4.5,Superb,"Good location to the main sites. Nice friendly staff, Appreciated the airport shuttle, Pleasant room"
5,Amazing,"Amazing hotel and great location in Gondar! The rooms were clean with strong WiFi, hot water, and there is also a nice pool. The breakfast buffet was huge and dinner in the restaurant was delicious. The reception staff were absolutely fantastic - they organised tours for me to the castles in Gondar, hiking in the Simien Mountains, and even a very early bus to My Tsebri. I highly recommend Haile Resort!"
2,Disappointing,"The hotel is situated in a good location. The check in process was smooth.
There was a foul smell coming from the bathrooms. The space looks well overdue for some renovations (cracks on walls, damaged doors etc. The checkout experience was horrible due to their inefficient system"
0.5,Do not go to haile gondar!!!!,The hotel facilities are very bad it doesn't fit the name or brand !!!!
2,Disappointing,"Really tasty food and coffee (really nicely decorated room for traditional coffee) and friendly staff.
We think this place is highly overrated. It is presented to be one of the best in country and recommended , but it was rather disappointing. Not sure about other Haile resorts in other parts of the country , but this one is not so good. For the price it could have been better , there is some maintenance needed in the room, water kettle to make tea in room is missing (which we had in other much cheaper hotels). There are some dents in wall and cables sticking out and lights in room were flickering , table lamp not working at all.
We had very unpleasant experience, hotel staff / cleaning lady came to knock at the door and when my partner opened she could not explain in English why she came and she just walked in the room (while me laying in bed half-naked, half-sleeping ) and turned on the lights - hit all the switches in room and left without word…
We had no words , and are still quite shocked by this.
This should NEVER happen!!!
Please make sure it won’t!!!
Also be aware that swimming pool of the resort is apparently also open for public, not only guests , and it was very crowded. Moreover, beds by the pool were also half-broken and not comfortable (again maintenance needed).

Too many things were just wrong here, so unfortunately we need to give low score for this place and cant recommend it as a place to stay in Gonder."

5,Very good hotel but expensive,"Very good hotel for Ethiopian standards. Very friendly, helpful staff. Very clean, large rooms. Decent TV. Bathroom needs to be renovated but hot shower. WiFi works because router is installed in front of the room. Fridge hardly cools. Kettle in the room. Breakfast is plentiful for Ethiopia and also includes western dishes and egg dishes. Fruit, bread. Unfortunately price too high."
5,Exceptional,I went with my wife and it was great experience

3,Good,"The hotel is in pretty worn conditions, quite hot at night, average restaurant. The nice thing is the pool, but please note that it's not restricted to hotel guests, so when we arrived on a Sunday, it was completely full with day users. So, in summary, the hotel is pretty average and the pool is nice."
4,International style accommodation in Gondar,"The hotel is very clean and the staff are very helpful. The pool looks good however we did not use it. Breakfast had many choices and including western dishes. Compared to Ethiopia the bed was comfortable and the towels were great. Specifically we could not close the bathroom door and our shower was not comfortable to operate. We had no working wifi in the room, unless we stood by the door."
5,Exceptional,Excellent views over Gondar and the surrounding mountains. Staff is very attenetive and friendly. Rooms are clean and nicely appointed.
5,Great option at the more luxurious end in Gondar,"This is a (relatively) more expensive but very good option in Gondar. It's conveniently placed, in a beautiful setting, and benefits from a slick and comfortable restaurant on the premises. The outside terrace is great for an evening drink while watching the sun set over Gondar. If you're planning to hike the Simiens and you book the return night at the resort, then they will store your luggage for free. We were also upgraded to a Junior Suite without any particular reason we could ascertain. Water pressure is not great in the showers but I think that's more to do with Gondar than the hotel. The staff were great - warm, friendly and engaged. If you're a bit tired of roughing it this makes for a very nice change of pace at (by western standards) an affordable price."

4,Comfortable stay,"We stayed here before and after our Simien Mountains bike. Service is great and they include complimentary airport pick up and drop off. Both rooms we stayed in were comfortable and had everything we needed. They are dark though when the sun goes down. Lighting is not very good. WiFi is terrible in the rooms though, you can only get it when you’re standing right up against the door. Better to just go outside to the lobby to use it which can be inconvenient at times. I would stay there again if I went back to Gondar"
5,Highly recommended without a doubt.,"The detail of the fruit tray upon arrival, very comfortable room with fridge and kettle and an excellent breakfast. The views from the room are great. Highly recommended. The staff is very attentive."
5,Exceptional,
2,Fair,"Bad check in experience - no towels provided and had to ask 4 times over the course of 5 hours before we got them. Bedsheets were also very damp and weren't changed until hours after we asked. Bathroom ventilation system was awful, could smell toilets and cigarette smoke from neighbouring room. Room walls paper thin, sandwiched between a noisy family and a guy who had his TV on full blast past 11pm until we reported it to reception. Lack of ventilation in the room, became incredibly hot in the morning. No kettle in room, no lift/elevator on the property either. Phone didn't work and no contact number sheet provided for calling reception quickly. Lack of conveniently placed power sockets in room. Free airport transfer was helpful however, WiFi decent and the breakfast was not bad."
4,Very good,The view of the Castle is good as is the location quite near the centre of town. The property has a very nice 16m. swimming pool which was functional at least during my visit. The restaurant has a wide choice and was pretty good
4,Very good,"They provided me with an excellent guide. The breakfast was good but the dinner that I had was inedible. Also Ethiopians seated next to me eating traditional Ethiopian food said it was just barely ok. Stay there for the hotel part but don’t eat anything there except breakfast, would be my recommendation"
5,Exceptional,"Very nice hotel. Clean, very well located in town close to everything. Varied breakfast and very attentive staff."
5,Exceptional,
4,Very good,"I like the big room they gave us unfortunately the hot tub in the room didn't worked. Also in the amenities it said dry & wet sauna, gym & pool yet at the moment they only have the pool!! We wanted to enjoy the dry sauna!!!"
4,Very good,A good hotel Spa/sauna had not been working for 3 months but was being advertised when booked
5,Fully recommend,We are there only 2 days but we enjoy this time very much. Hotel Staff was very kind and helpful. Room was very clean and well equiped ( there was even hair conditiiner! :D hairdryer and cold drinks).
4,"Wonderful staff, but a bit maintanance required","Staff was wonderful, as usual in Ethiopia. Wifi signal was too weak in my room, had to connect from the corridor. Lighting in the room insufficient, most sockets didn't work. No mosquito net. Breakfast ok. No elevator (not a big deal for me, but could be an issue for others). Location is very good, quite close to the Four Sisters restaurant and not far away from the castle."
