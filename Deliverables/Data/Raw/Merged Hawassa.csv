5,Where 5+ star hotel experience exists,"Haile Resort Hawassa is a great choice for anyone who values cleanliness, friendliness, and professional service. The resort is very well-maintained, with spotless rooms and facilities. The staff are courteous, attentive, and efficient, making sure that every guest feels welcome and satisfied. The service is excellent, from the check-in to the check-out, and everything in between. The resort also has a lot of amenities, such as a pool, a spa, a gym, and a restaurant. The location is ideal, as it is close to the lake and the city center. I had a fantastic time at Haile Resort Hawassa and I would definitely stay there again. It is a gem of a place in Ethiopia."

5,Unforgettable and Memorable,Excellent and Fantastic
5,Exceptional,I’m really happy staying Haile Resort all stuffs great coustemr service I wish staying longer I’m really happy for every. It’s great and clean.
5,Exceptional,"The pool, spa, gym, seating areas, views, staff, and the rooms were absolutely fantastic
Mekdes M and Wedeye were great servers and help!
The curtain in 2233 is a bit broken, but we made it work. The water bottles were very expensive for staying a few days. It would be very nice if those staying at the hotel could have a discount at the restaurants.
Also- it would be very nice if the pools had sitting areas in the pool! It gets very hot and it’s nice to sit in shallow water
Also- it’d be nice to have plants or something on the first floor roof. The views are so nice but the dirty roofs were a bit off putting"
5,Great Hospitality.,"Other Ethiopian hotels should learn from them.Try to make the swimming pool warm. All the facilities were best and keep it up. And it is also best for family vacation.
Cold swimming pool."
1.5,Good location but poor service!,"The location was amazing. Specifically, the wine bar was great.
They didn’t have towels in the bathroom. We literally had to beg them for it. When i called the reception downstairs, they actually asked whether we have taken it or misplaced the towels. I had to go down to the reception 4 times to ask for towels and bathrobe again and again. They kept saying they’ll send it right away every time which was so frustrating. They finally brought it to our room almost 6hrs later which was very frustrating."
5,Exceptional,The staff was very friendly and the lakeview was amazing. The food in the Restaurant was really good.
5,Exceptional,"We enjoyed our stay in Haile Resort in Hawassa very much. The views over the lake where so nice at sunset. We enjoyed the birdlife. The boat trip from the hotel was very nice, we saw hippo's. The food is great and staff is super friendly. Really recommand this hotel

5,dream by the lake,"The staff were extremely friendly and polite. This started at the door with security and continued all the way to the free shuttle to the airport. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the toilets are constantly cleaned. The location on the lake is fantastic, see photo. The only negative point was that the restaurant, like many other restaurants in Ethiopia, uses glutamate for cooking. If you don't have a problem with that, then we can recommend the Haile Resort without reservation."
5,Exceptional,"Excellent resort, beautiful location, friendly staff!"
5,Comfortable stay and helpful staff,"Great resort, very good service, beautiful lake-side view and relaxed atmosphere."
5,Exceptional,"Excellent Hotel. Friendly and very accommodating staff. Excellent food and selection of choices at breakfast. Beautiful setting.

4,Lectures at MSc. course Wonod Genet,"Very good but the shower needed to be turn on in 30 minutes every morgning in order to get hot water ( 2nd floor, sea view), and the internet connection was extremely unstable. Stable internet connection was one of the main reason the hotel was chosen because I needed to do som home work in the afternoons."

5,Exceptional,Very nice resort right on the lake. Very friendly and helpful staff. Food in numerous varieties - there is something for everyone here.

5,Exceptional,Really clean and pleasant room. The staff was extremely friendly. Beautiful scenery.

3,Good,There is a huge difference between good and bad staff behavior.
3,Good wievs is the best,"The staff is very friendly and service minded, the wiev from the hotel is amazing and very very stuning. The hotel is a bit old and not up to date. The pool area is a bit ruff and it is cold and dirty water. The breakfast is poor, not much to choose from. The staff really tries their best and are very helpfull."
5,Exceptional,Friendly staff and excellent food! We stayed at the hotel as a family for five days. We would do it again.
