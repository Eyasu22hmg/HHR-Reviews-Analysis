4,Lakeside comfort in Ziway,"A very well kept resort with friendly and helpful staff, who can arrange trips on the nearby lake at reasonable rates.
The location is a little way out of town, but it's handy for the lake"

4,Great stay - we'll be back,"We had a wonderful stay at Ziway. We arrived at 8.30am and we were allowed to check in to our room early, without question. Breakfast was great - fresh eggs / omelette made to order, great coffee. T The resort is full of birds - fish eagles and little yellow and blue birds and we loved how lush and well kept the property gardens were.
the pool was clean and well presented but there were only 4 lounge chairs - wooden, no mattresses and slightly broken. This is an area that could be addressed. We were given pool towels which was great.

The bungalows are small and the fan in our room sounded like an airplane taking off so we couldn't use it. It would be great if there was a mosquito mesh on the window so we could sleep with the window open."
4,The orders are so great they are well trained of the customer service. I like to appreciate,"The breakfast was great and the location is easily locatable.
Some of the facilties like sauna steam are very poor, the TV shall include ds tv"
3,Pleasant,"That we were not satisfied with our room and they helped us in changing rooms
Need to have a small refrigerator and a small lamp in each bedroom"
3,Pleasant,"The junior suite should have a balcony - but that does not exist in this hotel. Text should be updated.
The boat on the lake service had been cancelled."

5,Exceptional,"The rooms are good, I had a spacious room and the bed was adequate, where the mattress was soft. The resort has a nice garden to stroll through, good gym and nice pool. The breakfast is typical Ethiopian and serves you county’s delights in abundance. The staff is great and certainly a place to go back too."
5,Exceptional,"As I have visited the hotel several times already, I was welcomed home by the staff, they received me with open arms and made my stay very nice again. Always in for a chat and a smile was always given. The place allows for some strolling outside to the lakeside, enjoy a drink on the terras and the food is taste. Internet is stable and available on the compound. In for coffee? Ask for the local ""buna"" or coffee and you will be teated with a delight."
4,Very good,"Very nice and welcoming staff in all areas. Good food. There is a nice looking pool, but I never used it. Fair internet connection for Ethiopia. Price - value is correct. The garden is very nice. You can observe monheys and many types of birds. There is access to the lake shore walk way, which is quite nice. They offer nice boat tours in the lake. This time I was not able to do, but I will probably next time. For sure I will come back. Beds are very good. Also, all found clean, however there are always coming in some ants from the gardens, what may be uncomfortable for some people. There is given free bottled drinking water every day. Housekeeping is done nicely every day. The only thing they may improve. Rusty water come out on hand wash and shower, it smells metallic rusty and has a yellow colour, probably rusted tank. Also, it would be nice to get in every room a good mosquito net installed fix as standard. Now you have to ask for it. I would suggest to sacrify one of the guest rooms in the garden to install the massage room there, just to be able to have a nicer place for this. It's definitely the best hotel option in Ziway. I will come back again."
2,Fair,The property needs a lot of work.
2,Reservation not honored,"We arrived at night at the hotel and they didn’t have our pre-paid reservation in their computer. So they gave us a lesser room at a higher rate. A wedding was blasting until 11pm right outside our door and there were mosquitoes inside our mosquito net. We were surprised that the quality of this chain hotel was so much lower here than in Awassa, where we stayed the night before."
5,Exceptional,"The friendliness of all the staff deserves special mention, especially the manager, who was always on hand to help. The location of the Haile Resort couldn't be better. Nature lovers will get their money's worth."
4,Very good,"Stayed in the Garden rooms, & while the rooms are nice, there are no windows that can be opened except the patio door, which is open to the front. I prefer the rooms in the main building, where widows can be opened."
3,Good,"Getting a bit tired and rough around the edges - staff not super friendly but OK - flies buzzing around the breakfast buffet food (in fact quite a few flies buzzing around Ziway) - rude pool and gym 'manager' shouting instructions to all guests. Positives: swimming pool, boat trip was fun to escape and see hippos. Generally Langano area is much nicer than Ziway. Same price as Sabana Beach resort yet Sabana Beach is idyllic."

5,Brilliant spot with excellent staff,"The place is a bit hard to reach from city centre but once you are in, every equipment caters all your comfort. A tiny gym and sauna room are inviting as well as the broad and spacious swimming pool. Room with lake view is superb as you can enjoy the sunrise from your window. Staff is really assistant and informative plus friendly. Bell boy offered to change my normal room to the room with lake view at no extra charge. Traditional Coffee shop is next to the lobby and you pay for only 10 birr. Overall, I do love the place. It's a really nice resort I've ever stayed at affordable price. I truly recommend the place."
4,Very good,"Very nice garden, well maintained. Good location that allows pleasant walks."
4,Very good,small house - nicely laid out - beautiful lake - boat tours with hippos possible
3,Good,It was a good stay. The workers didn't speak good English so communication is frustrating. The room was good and the workers try very hard to make you happy. Not top of the line but good.
