5,Wonderful visit—Loved Our Stay,"We rented a premium suite for our family of five, and added a comfortable cot for $29 a day. The two extremely comfortable adjoining rooms connected to a living area in the middle . It was worth it to pay the extra to wake up to the sunrise over the lake with the mountains. Absolutely gorgeous views. The air conditioning was a great asset, and the shower pressure was comfortably strong. The included morning buffet was great, but the a la carte menu took an hour to prepare every time, and it cost 2000ETB each time to feed five of us. While it was convenient to eat at the hotel sometimes, the food was better and cheaper at Paradise Lodge and the Tourisy Hotel."

5,Exceptional,It's an excellent stay me and family highly recommend this to people.
5,Exceptional,We stay here frequently because we can count on excellent service and everything being in working order. It is stress free. The staff are wonderful and we like the food very much.
5,Amazing staff with stunning scenery??,We had a short but amazing stay at Haile’s Arbaminch. Very helpful staff with amazing smiles. Clean environment with breathtaking scenery from a cliff.The food tastes great. I highly recommend the lake side rooms for the best terrace view. You can’t run out of activities out there but I wish the hotel extends its guest complementary facilities as a courtesy until shuttle pickup time rather than checkout time which is 11am for a 1:30pm afternoon airport shuttle service. We are deeply satisfied; and proud to recommend this hotel.
4,Very good,"Great view of Abaya and Chamo lakes, good restaurant, cleanness of the property."
5,Exceptional,Beautiful view. Super clean. Everything worked. Great shower in bathroom. Delicious food. We love staying here.
5,Exceptional,"This hotel has international standards, services, amenities including the spa. The food was superb and had variety. The location of the hotel is scenic overlooking the lake, hills and lash forest... A good getaway location away from busy cities."
5,Exceptional,"I am mesmerised by this perfect Hotel with heavenly kind of customer service. the only thing I can say is God bless the whole staff at Haile Resort, keep up the nice service."
3,Good,"The spa is really good and the people working in the spa department did a really good job. In generally all employees working in this property treat their customers really good. BUT they were out of some room aminities like shampoo, rooth paste, shower cup and some more. We are paying a lot but doesnt even get the basic aminities. Additionally the food in most of the haile resorts doesnt taste really good but it ua over priced. He need to work on that on most of his resturants."
5,Exceptional,Great staff. This hotel is the best and most respectful by far. They accommodate all needs for customers. I love them!
5,Room was spacious and clean. Staff vary friendly,"Room was spacious and clean. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel is in a good location, close to restaurants and other amenities."
5,Exceptional,"Haile Resort ,It was excellent in every sense!"
4,Very good,"I like the cleanness of the rooms and the restaurants. The serviceis excellent. The royal level reception starts right at the gate and follows you all the way untill you leave the resort. Steam, sauna and spa are complimentary. Massage is also at very reasonable price. Couple of things i didn't like- i had to book two rooms for family of 5 and i was charged for addtion bed they broght for a kid. This is a bit strange based on experinces in North American where hotles try their best to accomodate their guests. Another strange thing was at the check out you have to wait till someone is sent to check the room. I don't know if that is necessay specially if they have your credit card info. In my opnion, they are expected to trust their guest."

5,Exceptional,Very attentive staff. Meets our expectations. Everything is good
4,Very good,Very nice and relaxing
4,Very good,"we have been here multiple times over the last few years. It continues to be always clean and neat. The food is improving nicely. Service is many times slow, even now when few people are here in the hotel because of Covid 19. Service staff are very friendly and nice. the gym is cleaner than before and the machines are working. They should close the doors at night to limit mosquitoes in the hotel lobby."
4,Very good,"The location on the hill overlooking the lake is good, and the staff and food are also good. However, the front desk does not provide any tourist information such as access to nearby World Heritage sites, so you have to look it up yourself. Since the hotel is in such a good location, it would be nice to have a tour desk. Guests with ample time and budget seem to rent 4WDs and go out on their own. No one staying at this hotel seems to go to the world-famous Konso in a poor local minibus."
4,Very good,"The scenery from the escarpment down to the jungle, 2 lakes and hills in the background is great!"
5,Our best hotel experience in Ethiopia,"Our best hotel experience in Ethiopia. The place is nice with a beautiful view of the 2 lakes. The establishment is recent, well equipped and comfortable. The restaurant is very good too and the staff attentive."
3,Good,Very clean and sharp. Great views. Great help staff
5,Exceptional,Great location and views. Staff very helpful. Good food.
4,Very good,"This new hotel in Arba Minch is beautifully located at the Rift Valley, above the natural reserve forest and the valley lakes. Very nice facilities, good food, and very nice staff. Good opportunities to excursions to the 40 springs, lake Chamo, and Dorze villages."
5,Exceptional,
5,Attentive and exceptional location for a sweet short stay,"Hospitality and attentiveness of all staff from the beginning to the end.

4.5,Extraordinary stay and comfort.,Diverse and really nutritional
5,Wonderful,"Exceptional staff at the front desk, business office, housekeeping, and particularly the dining rooms. Beds were comfortable."
4.5,Very good,"The staff was exceptionally knowledgeable and very welcoming. They went out of their way to ensure that we were taken care of. The ambience of the resort is quite breathtaking. The breakfast buffet was quite nice, but could have offered more English menu items. I would definitely recommend it for anyone visiting Arba Minche.
The only negative part of the stay was the WIFI. The wifi was absolutely horrible. It worked off and on during the day throughout the resort, and it never worked in the room. We had to use phone data or a portable myfi when in the room."
4,fine stay with gorgeous views of two lakes,"beautiful views, friendly and helpful staff`"
4.5,Superb,"When we arrived, we were told that the booking they recieved didnt include lake view, however my booking disagreed.
The staff were very customer friendly, and the next day when the lake view room was available, they switched us. The rooms had a great standard. Best placed Ive stayed in Ethiopia. The pool was great and clean.
There weren't any evening activites, like live music."
4.5,Highly recommend! Worth a visit.,"Fantastic views and wonderful service.
The staff were friendly, polite, and attentive but English was very limited so some things were difficult to communicate."
5,Exceptional hotel in beautiful location,"There is so much to like about this hotel. The setting, looking out to the forests, lakes and mountains is stunning. The service is first class with every member of staff eager to please. Mr Getasew was particularly impressive and ensured that our stay was as enjoyable as possible. There is a nice choice at breakfast. The rooms are comfortable and spotlessly clean. I would stress the importance of booking a lake view room as this is very much part of the experience with this hotel. Watching the sunrise from the balcony was a real highlight. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and would say that it is the must stay place in Arba Minch. For anyone interested in touring it is the perfect stay for a short break. Those people wishing for relaxation in a beautiful location could enjoy longer with the leisure facilities. A quality hotel in an area in which top accommodation is hard to find.
The communication via 'messages' on Booking.com was not up to the usual standard and needs tweaking."
4.5,An excellent experience! Would recommend for anyone but smokers :D,"Almost everything.
There was only one place for smoking and paying for things was always a bit slow."
4,Very good,"I really satisfied and enjoy thanks haile resorts
